Welcome to my creative dev journey. As of now, I am learning more about CSS and JS while dabbling in with 3JS and 
react. 

In here, I will share my progress as a developer by posting small projects and updating this repository
as the journey continues.

The repository will include the following:
- UI made from vanilla HTML, CSS, JS.
- 3JS experiments I dabble with.
- Eventually some react stuff later down the line. 

If you ever are curious and want to view what I'm coding on a browser, you can view each of the files by clicking on
the HTML file of the perspective project and running the live server extension via vs code. For web page builds, I plan
on creating a repository for page or site which will be available to view on GitHub Pages. 

Cheers! 
Miko / Bam
